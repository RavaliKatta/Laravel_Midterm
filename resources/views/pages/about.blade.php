    <p>For creative projects, we wrestle with something similar sometime after the bulk of the creative production is done but before a work is fully wrapped up. Yes, we’re editing and improving and refining and testing to see the results of these efforts, but we’re not just doing these things for their own sake. We’re certainly not doing it for the fun of it. We’re working to get somewhere. </p>
